# Co-Exposure

## Background
Air pollution is a complex mixture of particles and gases, yet current regulations are based on single toxicant levels failing to consider potential interactive outcomes of co-exposures. We hypothesized that compared to individual exposures, inhalation co-exposures to a particulate and a gaseous component of air pollution will result in unique transcriptional and biochemical outcomes.

## Methods
A whole-body inhalation exposure to ultrafine carbon black (CB), and ozone (O3) was performed, and the impact of single and multiple exposures was studied at relevant deposition levels. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to CB (10 mg/m3) and/or O3 (2 ppm) for 3 hours (either a single exposure or four independent exposures). RNA was isolated from lungs and mRNA sequencing performed using the Illumina HiSeq. Lung pathology was evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry. Electron transport chain (ETC) activities and electron flow were assessed.
